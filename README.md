For this project, I leveraged Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build and compare various classification models. After rigorous experimentation, the Random Forest algorithm emerged as the top performer, boasting an impressive accuracy score of 89.3%! 🏆🌟
By converting wine quality scores into a binary classification task (good quality vs. not), I trained the Random Forest model to distinguish between high and low-quality wines based on 11 input variables. 📈🍇
Stay tuned for more insights and updates as I continue to explore the intersection of data science and enology. Cheers to the power of machine learning in unraveling the mysteries of wine quality! 🥂🔍
